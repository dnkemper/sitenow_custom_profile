The Print Block module creates a custom block that displays a link to the print ready version of a node. The link can contain text or an image. 

On install, if your theme has a three_33_third region, it will be added to that region automatically.

Configure the block's settings, including the link text and image, on the block configuration page at admin/structure/block/manage/print_block/print_block/configure.

Initially created for OVPR websites.
